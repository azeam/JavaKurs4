# The Game  
You are locked in a basement together with ugly (but friendly) monsters. Find the key to escape the basement!

## Gameplay  
Use A, W, D, S to move the character, hold down the shift key to run. In one of the chests the Master key - unlocking the door - is stashed. All chests are locked but you can pick up keys from the ground or trade them with the monsters (if you have a key to trade with). To start a trade, approach a monster carrying a key (the green monsters are carrying) and click on the key you wish to trade with. When you find the Master key, open the door in the bottom left corner. Note that not all games are possible to complete.
