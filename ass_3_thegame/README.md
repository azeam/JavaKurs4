# The Game  
You are locked in a basement together with ugly (but friendly) monsters. Find the door key to escape the basement!

## Gameplay  
Use A, W, D, S to move the character, hold down the shift key to run. In one of the chests the door key - unlocking the basement door - is stashed. All chests are also locked but you can pick up chest keys from the ground or trade them with the monsters (if you have a chest key to trade with). To start a trade, approach a monster carrying a key (the green monsters are carrying, blue ones are not) and click on the key you wish to trade with. When you find the door key, open the door in the bottom left corner. Note that not all games are possible to complete and you might be stuck in the basement for all eternity.
