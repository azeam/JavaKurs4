# The Basement  
You are locked in a basement together with ugly (but friendly) monsters. Find the door key to escape the basement!

## Gameplay  
Use W, A, S, D to move the main character. In one of the chests the door key - unlocking the basement door - is stashed. All chests are also locked but you can pick up chest keys from the ground or trade them with the monsters (if you have a chest key to trade with). To start a trade, approach a monster carrying a key (the purple monsters are carrying, white ones are not) and click on the key you wish to trade with. The monsters will also randomly drop keys on the ground that you can pick up. When you find the door key, open the door in the bottom left corner. Some settings can be changed in the Constants.java file (number of rooms, monsters, items etc.).

## Note  
Not all games are possible to complete and you might be stuck in the basement for all eternity, you have been warned! (Or you can just click "New game").
